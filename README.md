# Whisper Fine-tuning for Dialect Adaptation

A specialized system for fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model to significantly improve speech recognition accuracy across different English dialects.

## Approach & Methodology

Our approach combines transfer learning with dialect-specific adaptation to create a robust speech recognition system that performs well across diverse English accents. The methodology follows these core principles:

1. **Transfer Learning Foundation**: We leverage pre-trained Whisper models as our foundation, preserving their general speech recognition capabilities while adapting to specific dialects.

2. **Dialect-Specific Adaptation**: Rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach, we implement targeted fine-tuning for each dialect, allowing the model to learn specific phonetic patterns and linguistic variations.

3. **Progressive Fine-tuning**: We employ a multi-stage fine-tuning process that gradually adapts the model, preserving general knowledge while incorporating dialect-specific features.

4. **Two-Stage Error Correction**: Beyond the primary ASR model, we implement a secondary T5-based sequence-to-sequence model specifically trained to correct common ASR errors in each dialect.

5. **Quantitative Evaluation**: We use specialized metrics to measure improvements across dialects, focusing on Word Error Rate (WER) reduction and phonetic accuracy.

## Data Preprocessing & Selection

Our data preprocessing pipeline is critical to the success of dialect-specific fine-tuning:

### Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset**: Mozilla Common Voice corpus with dialect annotations
- **Supplementary Data**: Specialized dialect-specific datasets for underrepresented accents
- **Synthetic Data**: Generated samples for data augmentation and balancing

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Audio Normalization**: All audio is converted to 16kHz mono format with consistent volume levels
2. **Transcription Cleaning**: Standardized text normalization to ensure consistent training targets
3. **Dialect Labeling**: Accurate identification and verification of dialect for each sample
4. **Quality Filtering**: Removal of low-quality samples based on signal-to-noise ratio and clarity metrics

### Data Augmentation
- **Acoustic Augmentation**: Speed perturbation (0.9x-1.1x), pitch shifting (±10%), and dynamic range compression
- **Environmental Augmentation**: Addition of background noise at varying SNR levels (5-20dB)
- **Dialect-Specific Augmentation**: Targeted augmentation techniques for underrepresented dialects

### Dataset Balancing
- **Stratified Sampling**: Ensuring balanced representation across dialects
- **Difficulty Stratification**: Including samples of varying complexity for robust training
- **Length Distribution**: Balancing short, medium, and long utterances

## Model Architecture & Tuning Process

### Model Architecture

Our system consists of two primary components:

1. **Dialect-Adapted Whisper Models**
   - **Base Architecture**: Whisper-small (244M parameters) encoder-decoder transformer
   - **Encoder Modifications**: Enhanced with dialect-specific attention mechanisms
   - **Decoder Adaptations**: Modified with dialect-aware token embeddings
   - **Dialect Identification**: Additional classification head for dialect identification

2. **T5-based Error Correction Model**
   - **Base Architecture**: T5-small (60M parameters)
   - **Input Format**: Specialized prefix-based conditioning for error correction
   - **Output Format**: Clean, corrected transcription text
   - **Dialect-Specific Versions**: Separate models fine-tuned for each dialect's error patterns

### Fine-Tuning Process

Our fine-tuning process follows a carefully designed multi-stage approach:

1. **Initial Adaptation Phase**
   - **Frozen Encoder**: Keep encoder weights frozen to preserve acoustic feature extraction
   - **Decoder Adaptation**: Fine-tune only the decoder on general transcription data
   - **Learning Rate**: 5e-5 with linear warmup over first 10% of steps
   - **Training Duration**: 1-2 epochs on general dataset

2. **Dialect-Specific Phase**
   - **Partial Encoder Unfreezing**: Gradually unfreeze top encoder layers
   - **Layer-wise Learning Rate Decay**: Lower learning rates (1e-5) for base layers, higher (3e-5) for top layers
   - **Dialect-Specific Data**: Focus exclusively on single-dialect data
   - **Specialized Loss Function**: Weighted loss emphasizing dialect-specific phonetic patterns
   - **Training Duration**: 3-5 epochs with early stopping based on dialect-specific validation set

3. **Error Correction Model Tuning**
   - **Training Data**: Pairs of (ASR output, correct transcription) from dialect-specific validation errors
   - **Specialized Objective**: Focused on common error patterns in each dialect
   - **Inference Optimization**: Beam search with width 5 for optimal correction candidates

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Training Infrastructure**: 2x NVIDIA A100 GPUs with mixed precision (FP16)
- **Batch Size**: Dynamic batching with 8-16 samples per GPU
- **Gradient Accumulation**: 4 steps for effective batch size of 32-64
- **Optimization**: AdamW optimizer with weight decay 0.01
- **Regularization**: Dropout (0.1) and layer normalization
- **Checkpointing**: Model checkpoints saved every 1000 steps with validation
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 3 evaluations with no improvement in WER
